# Frog
Frog:
A simple game.
The player needs to control the rectangle (frog) at the center bottom of the window to avoid all moving blocks and reach the goal area (top of the window). 
When the frog is in the goal area (top of the window), user can start next level of the game by pressing'n' key.
‘n’ key should work only after the Frog reached the goal area. If ‘n’ key is pressed when the Frog is not at the goal area, nothing happens.
The Frog can move left and right but not up or down after it reached the goal area. It should be able to move up and down once again a level or a new game is started.
The speed of the blocks increases as level goes up.
If the frog collides with the block, the game fails and the player returns to level 1.
Pressing ‘q’ to exit the program.

Basic version:
Only one player is allowed to operate; the player uses arrow keys to control the movement of the frog.

Enhanced version:
Allow two players to play the game simultaneously, each controlling their own Frog using distinct controls. Player one control the left frog and player two control 
the right frog.
player one uses arrow keys to control the movement of left frog
player two uses w:up, a:left, s:down, d:right to control the movement of right frog
the level goes up only until both frogs reach the goal area and one of them press the 'n' button
if one of them collide the enemy block, both frogs go back to level 1
